- Create a new user
- Read a single user by his ID
- Update the details of a user

## Data Storage
A json file was used to store and manipulate data in order to properly visualise the flow of data, this was implemented using Node fs Module.



## Testing
Jest was used to test every functionality of this Project.     

Feel free to clone and `npm init` to get the feel of the app and `npm test` before adding more functionality if you wish.
